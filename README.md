# **Tic-Tac-Toe with ChatGPT**
This is an independent project that merges some of my web development skills with my curiosity about Prompt Engineering. Over the past few months, I have been actively testing, optimizing, and generating content using ChatGPT. This project represents my first collaboration with an AI chatbot for coding purposes.

## **Project Focus**
Developing a simple tic-tac-toe game where two players take turns attempting to form a row, column, or diagonal with three O's or three X's on a 3x3 grid.

## **Project Versions**
- [**ChatGPT-4o Version**](/tic_tac_toe_chatGPT_4o/): Utilized the capabilities of ChatGPT-4o.
- [**Code Copilot Version**](/tic_tac_toe_codeCopilot/): Leveraged the features of Code Copilot.

## **Technologies Used**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
